Most segmentation algorithms are sensitive to input algorithm parameters and the characteristics of input images (tissue morphology, staining, etc.). Because there can be large variability in the color, texture, and morphology of tissues within and across cancer types (heterogeneity can exist even within a tissue specimen), it is likely that a set of input parameters will not perform well\u2026\u00a0", "Publication Year": "2018", "Authors": ["Si Wen", "T.

Therefore, it requires verification of all steps involved in the process, including image segmentation and tracking algorithms. It is generally better to verify algorithms with computer-generated ground truth datasets, which, compared to manually annotated data, nowadays have reached high quality and can be produced in large quantities even for 3D time-lapse image sequences.
