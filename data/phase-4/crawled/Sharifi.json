The known DNA methylation/unmethylation mechanisms are sequence unspecific, but different cells with the same genome have different methylomes. Thus, additional processes bringing specificity to the methylation/unmethylation mechanisms are required. Searching for such processes, we demonstrated that CpG methylation states are influenced by the sequence context surrounding the CpGs.
