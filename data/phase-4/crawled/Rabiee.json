The spectral signatures collected in natural environments are invariably a mixture of the pure signatures of the various materials found within the spatial extent of the ground instantaneous field view of the imaging instrument. Spectral unmixing aims at inferring such pure spectral signatures, called endmembers, and the material fractions, called fractional abundances, at each pixel of the scene.
