Recent deep-learning techniques can offer a faster diagnosis and have shown promising results. However, they require large amounts of la-belled data which is not easily available for the task of dementia detection. One effective solution to sparse data problems is data augmentation, though the exact methods need to be selected carefully. To date, there has been no empirical study of data\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "Prostate Cancer has become one of the deadliest cancers among males in many nations. Pathologists use various approaches for the detection and the staging of prostate cancer. Microscopic inspection of biopsy tissues is the most accurate approach among them. The Gleason grading system is used to evaluate the stage of Prostate Cancer using prostate biopsy samples. The task of assigning a grade to each region in a tissue is a time-consuming task. Furthermore, this task often has several challenges\u2026\u00a0",

The goal during test-time is to accurately predict the class label of an unseen target domain instance based on revealed source domain side information (e.g. attributes) for unseen classes. Our method is based on viewing each source or target data as a mixture of seen class proportions and we postulate that the mixture patterns have to be similar if the two\u2026\u00a0",

In particular, standard likelihood training and decoding leads to dull and repetitive outputs. While some post-hoc fixes have been proposed, in particular top-$k$ and nucleus sampling, they do not address the fact that the token-level probabilities predicted by the model are poor. In this paper we show that the likelihood objective itself is at fault, resulting in a\u2026\u00a0",

While attention conveniently gives us one weight per input token and is easily extracted, it is often unclear toward what goal it is used as explanation. We find that often that goal, whether explicitly stated or not, is to find out what input tokens are the most relevant to a prediction, and that the implied user for the explanation is a\u2026\u00a0",

Our proposed approach is based on two stages. First, the dialogue contents are summarized into two categories with the same category. Second, term frequency \u2014 inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm is used\u2026\u00a0",

We focus on predicting the subset of MCI individuals that would progress to AD within three years (progressive MCI) and the subset of MCI individuals that do not progress to AD within this period (stable MCI). This prediction was conducted first as a standard binary\u2026\u00a0",

The main goal is to provide a software which is easy to use, and which allows fast training of standard recurrent and LSTM neural network language models. The toolkit obtains state-of-the-art performance on the standard Treebank corpus. To reduce the training time, BLAS and related libraries are supported, and it is possible to evaluate multiple word sequences in parallel\u2026\u00a0",

While domain adaptation research can have a positive impact on this problem, the most widely studied paradigms do not take into account the realities of clinical data sharing. To address this issue, we lay out a taxonomy of domain adaptation, parameterizing by what data is shareable. We show that the most realistic\u2026\u00a0",

Timely diagnosis is crucial to halt the progression of the disease. However, current diagnostic procedures are costly, invasive, and distressing. Early-stage AD manifests itself in speech disorders, which implies examining those.

        "Abstract": "Language assessment has a crucial role in the clinical diagnosis of several neurodegenerative diseases. The analysis of extended speech production is a precious source of information encompassing the phonetic, phonological, lexico-semantic, morpho-syntactic, and pragmatic levels of language organization. The knowledge about the distinctive linguistic variables identifying language deficits associated to different neurodegenerative diseases has progressively improved in the last years.

        "Abstract": "The authors studied language performance patterns in early stages of vascular dementia and Alzheimer disease. The objective was to clarify to what extent dissolution of language in vascular dementia is similar to that in Alzheimer disease. Both structured language tests (comprehension, repetition, reading, and naming tasks) and nonstructured language tests (object and picture description) were employed. The structured tasks evidenced impairment on complex auditory comprehension and on picture\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "Background Idea density (ID), a natural language processing\u2013based index, was developed to aid in the detection of dementia through the analysis of English narratives. However, it has not been applied to non-English languages due to the difficulties in translating grammatical concepts. In this study, we defined rules to count ideas in Japanese narratives based on a previous study and proposed a novel method to estimate ID in Japanese text using machine translation.

        "Abstract": "Bridging the exponentially growing gap between the numbers of unlabeled and labeled protein sequences, several studies adopted semi-supervised learning for protein sequence modeling. In these studies, models were pre-trained with a substantial amount of unlabeled data, and the representations were transferred to various downstream tasks. Most pre-training methods solely rely on language modeling and often exhibit limited performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel pre-training scheme\u2026\u00a0",

We first describe an unsupervised approach, which takes an input sentence and predicts itself in a contrastive objective, with only standard dropout used as noise. This simple method works surprisingly well, performing on par with previous supervised counterparts. We find that dropout acts as minimal data augmentation and removing it leads to a representation\u2026\u00a0",

The Transformer, for instance, is an illustrative example that generates abstract representations of tokens inputted to an encoder based on their relationships to all tokens in a sequence. Recent studies have shown that although such models are capable of learning syntactic features purely by seeing examples, explicitly feeding this information to deep learning models can significantly\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in language modeling using recurrent neural networks have made it viable to model language as distributions over characters. By learning to predict the next character on the basis of previous characters, such models have been shown to automatically internalize linguistic concepts such as words, sentences, subclauses and even sentiment. In this paper, we propose to leverage the internal states of a trained character language model to produce a novel type of word embedding which\u2026\u00a0",

Previously, most works focused on symbolic representation of knowledge graph with structure information, which can not handle new entities or entities with few facts well. In this paper, we propose a novel deep architecture to utilize both structural and textual information of entities. Specifically, we introduce three neural models to encode the\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "Recent breakthroughs of pretrained language models have shown the effectiveness of self-supervised learning for a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In addition to standard syntactic and semantic NLP tasks, pretrained models achieve strong improvements on tasks that involve real-world knowledge, suggesting that large-scale language modeling could be an implicit method to capture knowledge.

Here we show surprising evidence that language models can already learn to capture certain common sense knowledge. Our key observation is that a language model can compute the probability of any statement, and this probability can be used to evaluate the truthfulness of that statement.

Given that natural language is highly context-dependent, this further implies that in practice Softmax with distributed word embeddings does not have enough capacity to model natural language.

Regardless of whether they are built manually by domain experts or with automatic pipelines, KGs are often incomplete. To address this problem, there is a large amount of work that proposes using machine learning to complete these graphs by predicting new links.

        "Abstract": "Knowledge graphs contain knowledge about the world and provide a structured representation of this knowledge. Current knowledge graphs contain only a small subset of what is true in the world. Link prediction approaches aim at predicting new links for a knowledge graph given the existing links among the entities. Tensor factorization approaches have proved promising for such link prediction problems. Proposed in 1927, Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition is among the first tensor factorization\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "Joint representation learning of text and knowledge within a unified semantic space enables us to perform knowledge graph completion more accurately. In this work, we propose a novel framework to embed words, entities and relations into the same continuous vector space. In this model, both entity and relation embeddings are learned by taking knowledge graph and plain text into consideration. In experiments, we evaluate the joint learning model on three tasks including entity prediction\u2026\u00a0",
