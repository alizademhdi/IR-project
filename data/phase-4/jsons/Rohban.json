        "Abstract": "Segmenting the nuclei of cells in microscopy images is often the first step in the quantitative analysis of imaging data for biological and biomedical applications. Many bioimage analysis tools can segment nuclei in images but need to be selected and configured for every experiment. The 2018 Data Science Bowl attracted 3,891 teams worldwide to make the first attempt to build a segmentation method that could be applied to any two-dimensional light microscopy image of stained nuclei across\u2026\u00a0",

In medical imaging, accurate representation of tissue surfaces and volumes is important for tracking of disease biomarkers such as tissue morphology and shape features.

Virtual microscopy offers the unique possibility to study the compositions of tissues at a cellular scale. However, images acquired at such high spatial resolution are massive, contain complex information, and are therefore difficult to analyze automatically. In this article, we address the problem of individualization of size-varying and touching neurons in optical microscopy two\u2026\u00a0",

Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "It is a challenge to automatically and accurately segment the liver and tumors in computed tomography (CT) images, as the problem of over-segmentation or under-segmentation often appears when the Hounsfield unit (Hu) of liver and tumors is close to the Hu of other tissues or background. In this paper, we propose the spatial channel-wise convolution, a convolutional operation along the direction of the channel of feature maps, to extract mapping relationship of spatial information between pixels\u2026\u00a0",

However, most of these methods cannot efficiently segment objects of variable sizes and train on small and biased datasets, which are common for biomedical use cases.

The results indicate that while justice and vulnerability considerations are not absent in US municipal climate planning, the current framework for discussing and strategizing for justice and vulnerability are wanting, and lead me to provide the following conclusions\u2026\u00a0",

One of these sites (type I) represents the estrogen receptor which binds estradiol with high affinity (dissociation constant, 1 nM) and low capacity (1 pmol/uterus) and is translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The second component (type II) binds estradiol with a higher capacity than type I sites and displays a saturation curve which is sigmoidal. Hence, no\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "Fully convolutional networks (FCNs) are widely used for instance segmentation. One important challenge is to sufficiently train these networks to yield good generalizations for hard-to-learn pixels, correct prediction of which may greatly affect the success. A typical group of such hard-to-learn pixels are boundaries between instances. Many studies have developed strategies to pay more attention to learning these boundary pixels. They include designing multi-task networks with an additional\u2026\u00a0",

We formulate the segmentation of clustered nuclei as an optimization problem. A hypothesis concerning the nuclei, which involves a priori knowledge with respect to the shape of nuclei, is tested to solve the optimization problem. We first apply the distance transform to the clustered nuclei. A marker extraction scheme based on the H -minima transform is introduced to obtain the optimal\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "In a wide range of biological studies, it is highly desirable to visualize and analyze three-dimensional (3D) microscopic images. In this primer, we first introduce several major methods for visualizing typical 3D images and related multi-scale, multi-time-point, multi-color data sets. Then, we discuss three key categories of image analysis tasks, namely segmentation, registration, and annotation. We demonstrate how to pipeline these visualization and analysis modules using examples of\u2026\u00a0",

For some tasks in dermatology, state of the art models are able to beat human experts in terms of accuracy and type I/II errors. However, in the domain of medical applications, models should also be evaluated on how well they capture uncertainty in samples and labels. This aspect is key to building trust in computer-assisted systems, otherwise largely considered to be black boxes by their users. A common practice\u2026\u00a0",

Although deep learning (DL) based techniques have achieved state-of-the-art performances in image segmentation tasks, these methods are usually complex and require support of powerful computing resources. In addition, it is impractical to allocate advanced computing resources to each dark- or bright-field microscopy, which is widely\u2026\u00a0",

A major critical challenge for this class of experiments is the problem of image segmentation, or determining which parts of a microscope image correspond to which individual cells. Current approaches require many hours of manual curation and depend on approaches that are difficult to share between labs. They are also unable to robustly segment the cytoplasms of mammalian cells\u2026\u00a0",

Generating training data for classifiers is problematic, since only domain experts (e.g. pathologists) can correctly label ground truth data. Additionally, digital pathology datasets suffer from the \"minority class problem\", an issue where the number of exemplars from the non-target class outnumber target class exemplars which can bias the classifier and\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "Deep convolutional networks recently made many breakthroughs in medical image segmentation. Still, some anatomical artefacts may be observed in the segmentation results, with holes or inaccuracies near the object boundaries. To address these issues, loss functions that incorporate constraints, such as spatial information or prior knowledge, have been introduced. An example of such prior losses are the contour-based losses, which exploit distance maps to conduct point-by-point optimization\u2026\u00a0",

Most of recently proposed segmentation CNNs rely on loss functions where each voxel is treated indepen-dently, which does not convey the overall high-dimensional structure of a 3D organ. Such approaches fail to produce regularly shaped segmentation masks especially in complex cases. In this work, we design a loss function to compare segmentation masks\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "Deep convolutional networks recently made many breakthroughs in medical image segmentation. Still, some anatomical artefacts may be observed in the segmentation results, with holes or inaccuracies near the object boundaries. To address these issues, loss functions that incorporate constraints, such as spatial information or prior knowledge, have been introduced. An example of such prior losses are the contour-based losses, which exploit distance maps to conduct point-by-point optimization\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "The highest accuracy object detectors to date are based on a two-stage approach popularized by R-CNN, where a classifier is applied to a sparse set of candidate object locations. In contrast, one-stage detectors that are applied over a regular, dense sampling of possible object locations have the potential to be faster and simpler, but have trailed the accuracy of two-stage detectors thus far. In this paper, we investigate why this is the case. We discover that the extreme foreground-background\u2026\u00a0",
