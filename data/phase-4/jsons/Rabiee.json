        "Abstract": "This paper presents a structured dictionary-based model for hyperspectral data that incorporates both spectral and contextual characteristics of spectral samples. The idea is to partition the pixels of a hyperspectral image into a number of spatial neighborhoods called contextual groups and to model the pixels inside a group as members of a common subspace. That is, each pixel is represented using a linear combination of a few dictionary elements learned from the data, but since pixels inside a\u2026\u00a0",

The challenges to learn such a representation are two-fold. Firstly, the sample size is not often large enough to learn a rich generalizable representation through conventional techniques. Secondly, while only normal samples are available at training, the learned features should be discriminative of normal and anomalous samples.

        "Abstract": "The spectral features in hyperspectral imagery (HSI) contain significant structure that, if properly characterized, could enable more efficient data acquisition and improved data analysis. Because most pixels contain reflectances of just a few materials, we propose that a sparse coding model is well-matched to HSI data. Sparsity models consider each pixel as a combination of just a few elements from a larger dictionary, and this approach has proven effective in a wide range of applications\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "We introduce a powerful student-teacher framework for the challenging problem of unsupervised anomaly detection and pixel-precise anomaly segmentation in high-resolution images. Student networks are trained to regress the output of a descriptive teacher network that was pretrained on a large dataset of patches from natural images. This circumvents the need for prior data annotation. Anomalies are detected when the outputs of the student networks differ from that of the teacher network. This\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "Sensor-equipped smartphones and wearables are transforming a variety of mobile apps ranging from health monitoring to digital assistants. However, reliably inferring user behavior and context from noisy and complex sensor data collected under mobile device constraints remains an open problem, and a key bottleneck to sensor app development. In recent years, advances in the field of deep learning have resulted in nearly unprecedented gains in related inference tasks such as speech and object\u2026\u00a0",

Existing methods usually exploit visual information to analyze whether any abnormal events have occurred due to only visual sensors are generally equipped in public places. However, when an abnormal event in crowds occurs, sound information may be discriminative to assist the crowd analysis system to determine whether there is an abnormality. Compare with\u2026\u00a0",

In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end cascaded network of CNNs to jointly learn crowd count classification and density map estimation. Classifying crowd count into various groups is tantamount to coarsely estimating the total count in the image thereby incorporating a high-level prior into the density estimation network.

        "Abstract": "In this paper we introduce a novel method to detect and localize abnormal behaviors in crowd videos using Social Force model. For this purpose, a grid of particles is placed over the image and it is advected with the space-time average of optical flow. By treating the moving particles as individuals, their interaction forces are estimated using social force model. The interaction force is then mapped into the image plane to obtain Force Flow for every pixel in every frame. Randomly selected\u2026\u00a0",

Such scenes require a human surveyor to monitor multiple video screens, presenting crowds of people in a constantly changing sea of activity, and to identify signs of breaking violence early enough to alert help.

        "Abstract": ". Camera sensors are increasingly being combined with machine learning to perform various tasks such as intelligent surveillance. Due to its computational complexity, most of these machine learning al-gorithms are o\ufb04oaded to the cloud for processing. However, users are increasingly concerned about privacy issues such as function creep and malicious usage by third-party cloud providers. To alleviate this, we propose an edge-based \ufb01ltering stage that removes privacy-sensitive attributes before\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "In recent years there has been a growing interest in the study of sparse representation of signals. Using an overcomplete dictionary that contains prototype signal-atoms, signals are described by sparse linear combinations of these atoms. Applications that use sparse representation are many and include compression, regularization in inverse problems, feature extraction, and more. Recent activity in this field has concentrated mainly on the study of pursuit algorithms that decompose signals with\u2026\u00a0",

In this paper, to make full use of HSI information, we combined spectral and spatial information into a two-dimension image in a particular order by extracting a data cube and unfolding it.

Because most pixels contain reflectances of just a few materials, we propose that a sparse coding model is well-matched to HSI data. Sparsity models consider each pixel as a combination of just a few elements from a larger dictionary, and this approach has proven effective in a wide range of applications\u2026\u00a0",

However, due to the imbalance between a huge number of weights and limited training samples, many problems and difficulties have arisen from the use of deep learning methods in HSI classification. To handle this issue, an efficient deep learning-based HSI classification method, namely, spatial-aware network (SANet) has been proposed in this paper.

It replaces the least-squares (LS) loss in the standard joint sparse representation (JSR) model with a weighted LS loss and adopts a self-paced learning (SPL) strategy to learn the weights for neighboring pixels.

However, the existing collaborative representation-based HSI classification methods ignore the correlation among different classes. To overcome this problem, we propose a discriminative kernel collaborative representation and Tikhonov regularization method (DKCRT) for HSI classification, which can make the kernel collaborative representation\u2026\u00a0",

For HSI, there is much global and local redundancy and correlation (RAC) in spatial/spectral dimensions. In addition, denoising performance can be improved greatly if RAC is utilized efficiently in the denoising process. In this paper, an HSI denoising method is proposed by jointly utilizing the global and local RAC in spatial/spectral domains. First, sparse coding is\u2026\u00a0",

An energy function is investigated that models disparities in an image that are defined with respect to a local neighborhood system.

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Spectral pixel classification is one of the principal techniques used in hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis. In this article, we propose an unsupervised feature learning method for classification of hyperspectral images. The proposed method learns a dictionary of sub-feature basis representations from the spectral domain, which allows effective use of the correlated spectral data. The learned dictionary is then used in encoding convolutional samples from the hyperspectral input pixels\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "In recent years there has been a growing interest in the study of sparse representation of signals. Using an overcomplete dictionary that contains prototype signal-atoms, signals are described by sparse linear combinations of these atoms. Applications that use sparse representation are many and include compression, regularization in inverse problems, feature extraction, and more. Recent activity in this field concentrated mainly on the study of pursuit algorithms that decompose signals with\u2026\u00a0",

It aims at estimating the fractional abundances of pure spectral signatures (also called as endmembers) in each mixed pixel collected by an imaging spectrometer. In many situations, the identification of the end-member signatures in the original data set may be challenging due to insufficient spatial resolution, mixtures happening at different scales, and unavailability of completely pure spectral\u2026\u00a0",

The estimation of the unknown endmember spectra is conducted in a unified manner by generating the posterior distribution of abundances and endmember parameters under a hierarchical Bayesian model. This model assumes conjugate prior\u2026\u00a0",

It assumes that the observed image signatures can be expressed in the form of linear combinations of a number of pure spectral signatures known in advance (e.g., spectra collected on the ground by a field spectroradiometer). Unmixing then amounts to finding the optimal subset of signatures in a (potentially very large) spectral library that can best model each mixed pixel in the\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "Hyperspectral images classification has been one of the most popular research areas in remote sensing community in the past decades. However, there are still some difficulties that need specific attentions, such as the lack of enough labeled samples for training the classifier and the high dimensionality problem, which degrade the supervised classification performance dramatically. The main idea of semisupervised learning is to overcome the contribution of unlabeled samples, which are available\u2026\u00a0",

The proposed method produces smoother classifications with respect to the intrinsic structure collectively revealed by known labeled and unlabeled points. Good accuracy in high dimensional spaces and low number of labeled samples (ill-posed situations) are produced as compared to\u2026\u00a0",

This novel method exploits the properties of Mercer's kernels to construct a family of composite kernels that easily combine spatial and spectral information. This framework of composite kernels demonstrates: 1) enhanced classification accuracy as compared to traditional approaches that take into account the spectral information only: 2) flexibility to balance between the spatial\u2026\u00a0",

The approach is an extension of existing approaches, using both spectral and spatial information for classification. The spatial information is derived by mathematical morphology and principal components of the hyperspectral data set, generating a set of different morphological profiles. The whole data set is classified by the Random Forest algorithm. However, the computational complexity as well\u2026\u00a0",

Selection of a useful subset of bands or derived features (spectral ratios, differences, derivatives) is always desirable, strongly affects the accuracy of the classification, and is often a practical necessity to keep the processing speed and memory requirements under control. This paper examines one possible procedure for selecting spectral derivatives to improve supervised\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "Reconstruction-based methods play an important role in unsupervised anomaly detection in images. Ideally, we expect a perfect reconstruction for normal samples and poor reconstruction for abnormal samples. Since the generalizability of deep neural networks is difficult to control, existing models such as autoencoder do not work well. In this work, we interpret the reconstruction of an image as a divide-and-assemble procedure. Surprisingly, by varying the granularity of division on feature maps\u2026\u00a0",

Most previous studies concentrated on guiding the student network to learn the same representations on the normality, neglecting the different behaviors of the abnormality. This leads to a high probability of false detection of subtle defects. To address such an issue, we propose to push representations on abnormal areas of the teacher and student network as\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "Reconstruction-based methods play an important role in unsupervised anomaly detection in images. Ideally, we expect a perfect reconstruction for normal samples and poor reconstruction for abnormal samples. Since the generalizability of deep neural networks is difficult to control, existing models such as autoencoder do not work well. In this work, we interpret the reconstruction of an image as a divide-and-assemble procedure. Surprisingly, by varying the granularity of division on feature maps\u2026\u00a0",

Anomaly detection involves making a binary decision as to whether an input image contains an anomaly, and anomaly segmentation aims to locate the anomaly on the pixel level. Support vector data description (SVDD) is a long-standing algorithm used for an anomaly detection, and we extend its deep learning variant to the patch-based method using self-supervised learning.

A limitation of kNN methods is the lack of segmentation map describing where the anomaly lies inside the image.

        "Abstract": "Anomaly detection (AD) aims to address the task of classification or localization of image anomalies. This paper addresses two pivotal issues of reconstruction-based approaches to AD in images, namely, model adaptation and reconstruction gap. The former generalizes an AD model to tackling a broad range of object categories, while the latter provides useful clues for localizing abnormal regions. At the core of our method is an unsupervised universal model, termed as Metaformer, which leverages\u2026\u00a0",

OC-NN combines the ability of deep networks to extract a progressively rich representation of data with the one-class objective of creating a tight envelope around normal data. The OC-NN approach breaks new ground for the following crucial reason: data representation in the hidden layer is driven by the OC-NN objective and is thus customized for anomaly detection.

In general, industrial visual anomaly detection problems distinguish normal and abnormal data through small morphological differences, such as cracks and stains. Nevertheless, most existing algorithms focus on capturing not morphological features, but semantic features of normal data. Therefore, they yield poor performance on real-world visual inspection, even\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "One-class novelty detection is the process of determining if a query example differs from the training examples (the target class). Most of previous strategies attempt to learn the real characteristics of target sample by using generative adversarial networks (GANs) methods. However, the training process of GANs remains challenging, suffering from instability issues such as mode collapse and vanishing gradients. In this paper, by adopting non-adversarial generative networks, a novel decoder\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "Abnormal crowd behaviour detection attracts a large interest due to its importance in video surveillance scenarios. However, the ambiguity and the lack of sufficient abnormal ground truth data makes end-to-end training of large deep networks hard in this domain. In this paper we propose to use Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs), which are trained to generate only the normal distribution of the data. During the adversarial GAN training, a discriminator (D) is used as a supervisor for the\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) learn a deep generative model that is able to synthesize novel, high-dimensional data samples. New data samples are synthesized by passing latent samples, drawn from a chosen prior distribution, through the generative model.
