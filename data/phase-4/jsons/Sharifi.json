        "Abstract": "Embryonic stem (ES) cells are considered to exist in a ground state if shielded from differentiation triggers. Here we show that FGF4 and TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway inhibitors, designated R2i, not only provide the ground state pluripotency in production and maintenance of na\u00efve ES cells from blastocysts of different mouse strains, but also maintain ES cells with higher genomic integrity following long-term cultivation compared with the chemical inhibition of the FGF4 and GSK3 pathways, known as 2i\u2026\u00a0",

The kernel paradigm beautifully decouples the learning algorithm from the underlying geometric space, which renders graph kernels important for the aforementioned applications.

EGC formation is more efficient, has a shorter culture period than somatic cell reprogramming, and does not require exogenous genetic manipulation. Therefore, EGCs are a good model to analyze mechanisms by which committed cells acquire a pluripotent state.

        "Abstract": "Background: Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a key regulator of multiple signaling pathways. Results: Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) positively regulates GSK-3 activity in both Wnt- and Akt-dependent pathways. Conclusion: Canonical Wnt signaling disrupts APC-Axin interaction and reduces GSK-3 activity. Significance: APC regulation of GSK-3 provides a novel mechanism for signaling through GSK-3 by Wnt and non-Wnt pathways. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is essential for many signaling\u2026\u00a0",

In practice, the true string sets in a sample are often unknown due to limitations in sequencing technology. In order to compare heterogeneous samples, genome graphs can be used to represent such sets of strings. However, a genome graph is generally able to represent a string set universe that contains multiple sets of strings in addition to the true string set\u2026\u00a0",

For graph data, a whole toolbox of data mining algorithms becomes available by defining a kernel function on instances of graphs.

We try to overcome this problem by defining expressive graph kernels\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "Basket Analysis, which is a standard method for data mining, derives frequent itemsets from database. However, its mining ability is limited to transaction data consisting of items. In reality, there are many applications where data are described in a more structural way, e.g. chemical compounds and Web browsing history. There are a few approaches that can discover characteristic patterns from graph-structured data in the field of machine learning. However, almost all of them are not suitable\u2026\u00a0",

For instance, the popular shortest path kernel scales as O(n4), where n is the number of nodes. In this paper, we present a class of graph kernels with computational complexity O(n2(m + log n + \u03b42 + d)), where \u03b4 is the graph diameter, m is the number of edges, and d is the dimension of the node attributes.

In contrast, by building a hierarchy of nested subgraphs, the Multiscale Laplacian Graph kernels (MLG kernels) that we define in this paper can account for structure at a range of different scales. At the heart of the MLG construction is another new graph kernel, called the Feature Space Laplacian\u2026\u00a0",

The known DNA methylation/unmethylation mechanisms are sequence unspecific, but different cells with the same genome have different methylomes. Thus, additional processes bringing specificity to the methylation/unmethylation mechanisms are required. Searching for such processes, we demonstrated that CpG methylation states are influenced by the sequence context surrounding the CpGs. We\u2026\u00a0",

The Set1 complex is responsible for most somatic H3K4me3 and contains the conserved subunit CxxC finger protein 1 (Cfp1), which binds to unmethylated CpGs and links H3K4me3 with CpG islands (CGIs). Here we report that Cfp1 plays unanticipated roles in organizing genome-wide H3K4me3 in embryonic stem cells.

The developmental competence of oocytes and embryos in PCOS patients is reduced to a certain extent (comparing to non-PCOS patients, the high quality embryo rate was decreased by 16% from the data of our centre) during the in vitro fertilization (IVF) process. Cross-talk between the oocyte and cumulus cells is critical for oocyte maturation and embryo competence. In this study, we have evaluated\u2026\u00a0",

In humans, PGC specification is very difficult to study in vivo. To address this, the combined use of human\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are immortal stem cells that own multi-lineage differentiation potential. ESCs are commonly derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of pre-implantation embryos. Due to their tremendous developmental capacity and unlimited self-renewal, ESCs have diverse biomedical applications. Different culture media have been developed to procure and maintain ESCs in a state of na\u00efve pluripotency, and to preserve a stable genome and epigenome during serial passaging.

EGC formation is more efficient, has a shorter culture period than somatic cell reprogramming, and does not require exogenous genetic manipulation. Therefore, EGCs are a good model to analyze mechanisms by which committed cells acquire a pluripotent state.

        "Abstract": "In the three decades since pluripotent mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were first described they have been derived and maintained by using various empirical combinations of feeder cells, conditioned media, cytokines, growth factors, hormones, fetal calf serum, and serum extracts. Consequently ES-cell self-renewal is generally considered to be dependent on multifactorial stimulation of dedicated transcriptional circuitries, pre-eminent among which is the activation of STAT3 by cytokines (ref. 8\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "In the three decades since pluripotent mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were first described they have been derived and maintained by using various empirical combinations of feeder cells, conditioned media, cytokines, growth factors, hormones, fetal calf serum, and serum extracts. Consequently ES-cell self-renewal is generally considered to be dependent on multifactorial stimulation of dedicated transcriptional circuitries, pre-eminent among which is the activation of STAT3 by cytokines (ref. 8\u2026\u00a0",

Many studies have established that microRNAs are important for cell fate choices, including the na\u00efve to primed pluripotency state transitions, and their intermediate state, the developmentally suspended diapause state in early development. However, the full extent of microRNAs associated with these stage transitions in human and mouse remain under-explored. By\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "The differentiation potential of pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can be manipulated via serum and medium conditions for direct cellular development or to maintain a na\u00efve ground state. The self-renewal state of ESCs can thus be induced by adding inhibitors of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (Gsk3), known as 2 inhibitors (2i) treatment.

DGCR8 is an RNA-binding protein that assists the RNase III enzyme Drosha in the processing of microRNAs (miRNAs), a subclass of small RNAs. Here we study the role of miRNAs in ES cell differentiation by generating a Dgcr8 knockout model. Analysis of mouse knockout ES cells shows that DGCR8 is essential for biogenesis of miRNAs.

        "Abstract": "Various strategies have been published enabling cardiomyocyte differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. However the complex nature of signaling pathways involved as well as line-to-line variability compromises the application of a particular protocol to robustly obtain cardiomyocytes from multiple iPS lines. Hence it is necessary to identify optimized protocols with alternative combinations of specific growth factors and small molecules to enhance the robustness of cardiac\u2026\u00a0",

Some piPSC lines were bFGF\u2010dependence and showed mouse EpiSC\u2010like morphology; other lines were LIF\u2010dependence and showed mouse ESC\u2010like morphology. Metastable state of piPSC line that required both LIF and bFGF was also reported. Because bona fide pig embryonic stem cells were not available, uncovering piPSC\u2026\u00a0",

In mouse, the transcription factor OCT4 restricts to ICM and plays a key role in TE/ICM specification and pluripotent regulatory networks. However, in pig, OCT4 does not restrict to ICM cells, suggesting a different molecular basis in TE/ICM specification and pluripotent regulatory\u2026\u00a0",

The tight regulation of these genes is crucial for reprogramming, but the mechanisms that regulate their expression in vivo have not been uncovered. Here we show that Nanog\u2014but\u2026\u00a0",

Their early expression, already in evidence within multipotential hematopoietic cell lines, has made it difficult to determine what extracellular effectors and transduction mechanisms might be directing the onset of their own transcription during embryogenesis. To circumvent this problem, we\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "We have proposed a three step model for the specification of left-right in mammalian embryos. The fundamental assumption is that handedness is imparted by an asymmetrical molecule. Conversion of molecular asymmetry to the cellular level gives a property to one side of the embryo to bias an otherwise random generation of an asymmetrical gradient which can be interpreted by developing organs. Rat embryos, treated at discrete stages, show a window of sensitivity for disruption of handedness, which\u2026\u00a0",

Little is known about factors that induce this reprogramming. Here, we demonstrate induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic or adult \ufb01broblasts by introducing four factors, Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4, under ES cell culture conditions. Unexpectedly, Nanog was dispensable. These cells, which we designated iPS\u2026\u00a0",

Inhibition of GSK3 promotes ESC self-renewal by abrogating T-cell factor 3 (TCF3)-mediated repression of the pluripotency network. How inhibition of MEK mediates ESC self-renewal, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we show that inhibition of MEK can significantly suppress lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (LEF1\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "Mouse and rat embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal can be maintained by dual inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) andmitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK). Inhibition of GSK3 promotes ESC self-renewal by abrogating T-cell factor 3 (TCF3)mediated repression of the pluripotency network. How inhibition of MEK mediates ESC self-renewal, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we show that inhibition of MEK can significantly suppress lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (LEF1) expression\u2026\u00a0",

We report that DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors improve reprogramming efficiency. In particular, valproic acid (VPA), an HDAC inhibitor, improves reprogramming efficiency by more than 100-fold, using Oct4-GFP as a reporter. VPA also enables efficient induction of pluripotent stem cells without introduction of the oncogene c-Myc.\u00a0",

How external signaling pathways connect to core self-renewal transcriptional circuits is largely unknown. To probe this, we chose BMP signaling, which is previously recognized as a master control for both self-renewal and lineage commitment of murine ES cells.

We have defined a 25-amino-acid sequence in axin that comprises the glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) interaction domain (GID). In contrast to full-length axin, which has been shown to antagonize Wnt signaling, the GID inhibits GSK-3\u03b2 in vivo and activates Wnt signaling. Similarly, mutants of axin lacking key regulatory domains such as the RGS domain, which\u2026\u00a0",

To define and characterize key components in this process, we have investigated the potential of embryonic stem (ES) cells to generate endoderm following their differentiation to embryoid bodies (EBs) in culture.

To date, however, their homogeneous cellular differentiation to specific cell types in vitro has proven difficult. Wnt signaling has been shown to play important roles in coordinating development, and we demonstrate that Wnt3a is differentially expressed at critical stages of human liver development in vivo. The essential role of Wnt3a in hepatocyte differentiation from hESCs is paralleled by our in vitro\u2026\u00a0",

A key histopathological feature of BPD is stunted late lung development, where the process of alveolarization -the generation of alveolar gas exchange units- is impeded, through mechanisms that remain largely unclear. As such, there is interest in the clarification both of the pathomechanisms at play in affected lungs, and the mechanisms of de novo alveoli generation in healthy, developing\u2026\u00a0",

These enriched lung-like populations expressed lung epithelial markers SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and CC10. First we show that rapid differentiation of ESCs requires a dissociated seeding method instead of an embryoid body culture method. We then investigated a two-step differentiation of ESCs into definitive endoderm by activin or A549-conditioned medium\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "The differentiation of murine and human embryonic stem (ES) cells into pancreatic cell types has been shown by several methods including spontaneous differentiation, formation of multi-lineage progenitors, lineage selection or transgene expression. However, these strategies led to a mixture of cells of all three primary germ layers and only a low percentage of definitive endoderm cells giving rise to pancreas, liver, lung and intestine.

        "Abstract": "Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have the potential to be used as unlimited resources for tissue replacement therapy, thereby compensating for organ donor shortage. To reach this goal, the molecular principles governing early differentiation events in the developing embryo need to be addressed, understood and properly implemented in vitro. Studies carried out in several vertebrate models have established that Nodal/Activin A, BMP, WNT and FGF signaling pathways regulate early embryo development and\u2026\u00a0",

        "Abstract": "Embryonic definitive endoderm (DE) generates the epithelial compartment of vital organs such as liver, pancreas, and intestine. However, purification of DE in mammals has not been achieved, limiting the molecular \"definition\" of endoderm, and hindering our understanding of DE development and attempts to produce endoderm from sources such as embryonic stem (ES) cells. Here, we describe purification of mouse DE using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and mice harboring a transgene\u2026\u00a0",
